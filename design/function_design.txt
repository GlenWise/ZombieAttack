function_design.txtZombie Defense is an event based program using Tkinter and PIL. Both modules are required to work this game. My game has classes for the initial screen, the whole game, the different enemies, the different towers (weapons), and different projectiles. The most important feature is making sure the zombies can move on their own, depending on where the track is going, and on level 4, it randomly choses paths to go up or down, to make the game more exciting and challenging. The function is the move function in the Enemy Class. Another important feature is the killing of enemies, where the tower fires a projectile, then checks in the enemy if it shares any of the same radius as the projectile, and if it does, it kills the enemy and launches a slower one. (If it’s a faster Enemy.) I also Implemented a “Big Boy” Enemy, where if he is shot a certain number of times, he explodes into a bunch of different zombies.
