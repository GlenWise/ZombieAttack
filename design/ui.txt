ui.txtFor my user interface, I based it off of my experience with other tower defense games, and how I felt it would be most comfortable. One that I used for a lot of inspiration was bloons TD1(http://coolmath-games.com/0-bloons-tower-defense-1/)  , hence why I gave it a shout out to TD4 in my video. I went with a basic initial screen, with a theme of an apocalyptic world. That’s why the buttons were taken from Fallout 3, and the background another video game. Instructions and back button I made as simplistic yet stylistic as well. I wanted it to be seen whatever is going on. That is why I put in the tower information, and the ability to select your tower. People in the study-thon thought it was needed to.
